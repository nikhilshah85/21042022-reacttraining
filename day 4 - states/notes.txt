props, here data can flow to childresn
	props are immutable,

	1.  they becme readonly
	2.  if the main value changes in parent, changes will not reflect in children 

	use state instead 

		this.state = {
				firstName:'Nikhil'

			    }
	1. When you have a value in state, and u wish to change it with a another function,(something like click of a button)
		u have to use setState
		
 		 changeName()
 		 {
  		  // this.state.firstName = "Nikita";
		  this.setState({firstName:'Nikita Sharam'});
	         }

	2. whn u use setState in a function, u have to bind it, in the constructor, to make changes to the state
		// this.changeName = this.changeName.bind(this);
