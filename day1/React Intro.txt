A user can browse internet from
	Laptop / Desktop
	Mobile Phone
	Tables
	Devise like a watch


	Screen size
	Hardware is differnt (RAM / Cache etc..)
	Source of internet is different
	Habbits (imageing watching a video on phne)
		

	To meet all this requirements, we have been introducted to 
		Client Centric development

	and we have a small problem here

	Client device, understands only 3 languages
		HTML, CSS and JS
		
		HTML is preety old, same with CSS
		JS was not OOPS based (everything is missing here)
			Thus improvement is here
		W3C gave us HTML5 (awsome)
		W3C also gave us CSS3 (more beautiful) 
			Bth HTML5 and CSS3 removed the dependency on thirdparty, plugins etc..
		W3C and ECMA together gave us ES2015, which is OOPS based JS
			This was a happy moment, however, ES was not that simple, as the developed were from server side
				they were from C#, C++, Java etc,
			ES was all about function

		Thus Microsoft took an initiative, took all the standards of ES2015-ES6 - as it was open source
			created compilers, classes, keywords, modules lots of things, 
			named it as Typescript, which is simlar to C# or Java

			Typescript is now used in React as well as Angular



			Introduction to react

			What is React - React is Client Side Development Library, for UI 
					Created and managed by (Meta-Facebook)

					It runs on Node server by google for development and production 

					It can work with server side as well, ASP.net, Java, etc...

					It used Component based development 
					Compoennt = HTML + CSS + JS

					2 Approach for development of component	
						a. For JS developers - Function Based Component 
						b. For C#,Java developers - Class based component
				

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			a. NodeJS - www.nodejs.org
			b. npm (Node package manager) - comes with node
			c. create-react-app package from npm
			d. VS Code
			


			node --version
			npm --version
			npm install create-react-app -g
			create-react-app firstreact

			after the app is created, delete node_module folder (or move it somehwere)
				give the folder to production alng iwth package.json
					they need to fire

			npm install
