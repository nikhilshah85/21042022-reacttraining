Hooks are virtual dom function, which cordinate data, functions and events for you 
they are used only function based components
Hooks were added in react 16.3 as beta, in 16.8 it was made official

useState hook- first hook

	
problem with State -
	1. to make a change to a state, we had setState function, this was used by developers in any function
		state = [
				firstname:'Nikhil',
				qualifiction: {hightest:'MCA'
						certifications:['.net','Azure','DevOps','ORM','OCM']
					     },
						clientProfile:[
				{clientId:101,'RBS','projectType:'Banking','Duration:'3 years'},
				{clientId:101,'Indian Navy','projectType:'Cargo','Duration:'2 years'}
							  ]
			];
	
	2. 
	chnageName()
	{
		this.setState(...); ---this isearching ur property from the state, states are goign to be heavy

		u can change anything in this function, state is so open and free
	}
		

		we will also need to bind change name, which is spgati witning VM

---------------------------
		instead they changed the architecture, 


		useState
		useEffect - apply side for the component




		1. Hooks can be used only with React Function based component
		2. Hooks can be called at the top level of the componet
		3. Hooks cannot be conditional
